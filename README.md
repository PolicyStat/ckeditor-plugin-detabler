# ckeditor-plugin-detabler

This plugin adds an "extract table contents" context menu item, which can be used to remove tables and convert the inner cells to paragraphs.

We have a pretty common use case that involves imported content, sometimes with incorrect levels of nested tables. Hopefully it is of use to others as well.
